# SwapBook  
SwapBook is intended to be a website for Wayne State University students to swap textbooks. The site allows students to list textbooks they no longer need to swap for textbooks they will need. The system can maintain a database of textbooks based on student listings, search functionality, verified access available only to WSU students and is moving toward being completely mobile responsive.
